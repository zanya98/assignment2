  <h1>Let Go</h1>
  <p>The following is a very meaningful story which is called "Let Go", and written by Dr.Billy Graham.</p>
  <p>A little child was playing one day with a very valuable vase.He put his hand into it and could not withdraw it. His father too, tired his best, but all in vain. They were thinking of breaking the vase when the father said, "Now, my son, make one more try. Open your hand and hold your fingers out straight as you see me doing, and then pull." </p>
  <p>To their astonishment the title fellow said, "O no, father, I couldn't put my fingers out like that, because if I did I would drop my penny."</p>
  <p>Smile, if you will but thousands of us are like that little boy, so holding on to the world's worthless penny that we cannot accept liberation. I beg you to drop the trifle in your heart. Surrender! Let Go!.</p>
